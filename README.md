Evaluating the Impact of Hurricane Intensity on Residential Property Prices

This project analyzes how **Hurricane Sandy** influenced residential property prices in New Jersey using a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** econometric framework. The study compares the housing markets of **Atlantic County** (high hurricane intensity) and **Sussex County** (low intensity) across a multi-year period to evaluate short- and long-term price shifts post-disaster.

## 📈 Overview

This study investigates:
- The causal effect of Hurricane Sandy on residential sale assessment values
- How disaster intensity alters real estate market behavior
- Whether federal aid, risk perception, or supply constraints explain market recovery

The analysis uses:
- **MOD-IV Historical Database** for New Jersey property data  
- **U.S. Census Bureau** demographics to ensure treatment-control balance  
- **HUD/FEMA** damage inspection data for hurricane intensity quantification

## 🛠️ Methods Used

- 📉 **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** estimation  
- ⏱️ **Event study** with municipality-level fixed effects  
- 🧪 **Falsification (placebo) testing**  
- 📊 **Balance testing** of socio-economic variables  
- 🧼 **Outlier filtering & preprocessing**  
- 📍 **R** for data wrangling, modeling, and visualization

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 🏚️ Properties in Atlantic County (treatment) saw an average **$53,760 increase** in sale assessments post-hurricane compared to control  
- 📉 Initial property values dropped post-disaster but recovered within **three quarters**
- 💡 Strong indication that insurance, location value, and redevelopment offset damage perception  
- 📉 Time effects show systemic post-hurricane price decline across both counties, but less intense in Sussex

## 📌 What I Learned

This capstone enhanced my:
- Ability to perform **causal inference using real-world public datasets**
- Knowledge of **econometric frameworks** in disaster economics
- Skills in **data storytelling**, report writing, and presenting findings with clarity

It also deepened my understanding of how housing markets **recover post-disaster**, the role of **federal insurance programs**, and how **risk perception shapes real estate value**.
